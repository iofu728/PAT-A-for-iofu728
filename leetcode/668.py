Nearly everyone has used the Multiplication Table. The multiplication table of size m x n is an integer matrix mat where mat[i][j] == i * j (1-indexed).

Given three integers m, n, and k, return the kth smallest element in the m x n multiplication table.

 

Example 1:


Input: m = 3, n = 3, k = 5
Output: 3
Explanation: The 5th smallest number is 3.
Example 2:


Input: m = 2, n = 3, k = 6
Output: 6
Explanation: The 6th smallest number is 6.
 

Constraints:

1 <= m, n <= 3 * 104
1 <= k <= m * n
